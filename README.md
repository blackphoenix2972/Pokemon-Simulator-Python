# Pokemon-Simulator-Python

## Description
This Python program interacts with the PokeAPI to allow users to catch and manage Pokémon. It includes functions for fetching Pokémon data, generating random Pokémon encounters, and saving detailed information about caught Pokémon to a text file. The program presents a menu to users, offering options to catch Pokémon, view their inventory, save data to a file, or exit. Users can catch Pokémon, see their collection, and save detailed Pokémon information to "my_pokemon_details.txt." It's a simple, text-based Pokémon management tool that doesn't require an API key for the PokeAPI.
